<!--
🔔 If you're SUBMITTING ICON, read this PR template CAREFULLY and follow the instructions!
     - But if your pull request DOESN'T relate to icon submissions, you can ignore all of this (even the CONTRIBUTING check) and make PR from scratch.
       - For non icon related PRs, WE STILL RECOMMEND AT LEAST GLANCE THE CONTRIBUTING FILE for possible prohibited actions (eg. editing JSONs)

========== PULL REQUEST TITLE FORMAT ==========
Copy-paste one of these formats (the text inside of quotes)
to THE TOP TEXT FIELD and replace "icon_name_here" with
the name of the site / brand / company / app / generic symbol.

> If icon with logo ➜
   ❝  New icon: icon_name_here  ❞
> If icon update ➜
   ❝  Update icon: icon_name_here  ❞
> If generic icon ➜
   ❝  New icon: icon_name_here (generic)  ❞
-->

- [ ] I have carefully read and followed [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED!

CONTRIBUTING document: https://is.gd/aegisicons_contributing

❌ IF YOU DON'T READ / FOLLOW THE CONTRIBUTING DOCUMENT,
❌ YOUR PR(s) MIGHT GET REJECTED AND, IN THE WORSE CASE, GET YOU BANNED.

❌ Removing that line = instant rejection.

If you actually read the document, then:
Replace space with x inside of the brackets: [ ] ➜ [x]
-->

**URL of the site:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED (unless it's generic icon)

🔞 If this entity is explicitly "not safe for work", please mention it in this section. -->

**Proof of the Aegis-compatible 2FA:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ OPTIONAL (not needed for icon updates or request fills)

Add either:
- Link to documentation page / announcement post related to TOTP / Google Authenticator 2FA (PREFERED OPTION #1)
- Link to 2FA Directory's GitHub pull request page for the service (PREFERED OPTION #2)
  - Search them here: https://is.gd/2fa_directory_prs
- Screenshot proof of the TOTP / Google Authenticator 2FA settings page or login prompt (IF EITHER PREFERED OPTION WASN'T AVAILABLE)
  - ❌ NO SCREENSHOTS FROM AEGIS APP, PERIOD! Only from the service you have the account on.
  - Censor sensitive info if needed (QR codes, 2FA seed codes, personal information etc.)
  
🔔 NOTE: Documentation link or screenshot should clearly mention that 2FA is (T)OTP / HOTP or any mobile 2FA app (eg. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, LastPass Authenticator etc.) or show section of the 2FA setup page with (censored) OTP 2FA QR code image. Otherwise we cannot be sure if 2FA actually is compatible for Aegis.

🔔 This is optional, but if we cannot find info about 2FA from the website, Google nor 2FA Directory, we have to ask you proof for it. -->

**Logo / icon info:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED!

For example:
- Direct URL of the logo file / press kit page / logo resource page.
- Short info of how did you get the logo.
  - For site embedded vectors, eg. ➜
      ❝  Extracted logo with SVG Gobbler from https://example.com/exact-page  ❞
  - For image tracing, eg. ➜
      ❝  Image traced of https://example.com/logo.jpg with Vectorizer.io  ❞
- If it's generic icon ➜
    ❝  [Icon name] from Phosphor Icons / Cryptocurrency Icons  ❞

❌ IT CANNOT BE JUST COPY-PASTE OF THE "URL of the site or app" PART. -->

**Background color info:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED (unless it's generic icon)

Fill this part based of this information:
- Is the color taken somewhere from the logo?
   - If YES, then add & edit this text for eg. ➜
      ❝  It's from the logo (`#add-hex-color-code-here`).  ❞
- Is color taken from the mentioned app / site? (And not from the logo)
   - If YES, then do either/all of these things:
      - Upload screenshot of the area where you got the color AND give URL of the page (unless it's from app)
         - How to upload screenshot: https://is.gd/github_attach_files
      - Give the HTML element name (eg. #footer) AND also URL of the page.

After this line, you can now comment freely. Thank you for following the instructions. -->
