<!--
🔔 If you're SUBMITTING ICON, read this PR template CAREFULLY and follow the instructions!
     - But if your pull request DOESN'T relate to icon submissions, you can ignore all of this (even the CONTRIBUTING check) and make PR from scratch.
       - For non icon related PRs, WE STILL RECOMMEND AT LEAST GLANCE THE CONTRIBUTING FILE for possible prohibited actions (eg. editing JSONs)

========== PULL REQUEST TITLE FORMAT ==========
Copy-paste one of these formats (the text inside of quotes)
to THE TOP TEXT FIELD and replace "icon_name_here" with
the name of the site / brand / company / app / generic symbol.

> If icon with logo ➜
   ❝  New icon: icon_name_here
> If icon update ➜
   ❝  Update icon: icon_name_here
> If generic icon ➜
   ❝  New icon: icon_name_here (generic)
-->

- [ ] I have carefully read and followed [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED!

CONTRIBUTING document: https://is.gd/aegisicons_contributing

❌ IF YOU DON'T READ / FOLLOW THE CONTRIBUTING DOCUMENT,
❌ YOUR PR(s) MIGHT GET REJECTED AND, IN THE WORSE CASE, GET YOU BANNED.

❌ Removing that line = instant rejection.

If you actually read the document, then:
Replace space with x inside of the brackets: [ ] ➜ [x]
-->

**URL of the site:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED, UNLESS it's generic icon.

🔞 If this entity is explicitly "not safe for work", please mention it in this section. -->

**Proof of the Aegis-compatible 2FA:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ OPTIONAL

Add either:
- Link to documentation page related to 2FA (PREFERED OPTION)
- Screenshot proof of the TOTP / Google Authenticator 2FA settings page (CENSOR SENSITIVE INFO IF NEEDED).

🔔 This is optional, but if we cannot find info about 2FA from the website, Google nor 2FA Directory,
we have to ask you proof for it. -->

**Logo / icon info:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED!

For example:
- Direct URL of the logo file / press kit page / logo resource page.
- Short info of how did you get the logo.
  - For site embedded vectors, eg. ➜
      ❝  Extracted logo with SVG Gobbler from https://example.com/exact-page  ❞
  - For image tracing, eg. ➜
      ❝  Image traced of https://example.com/logo.jpg with Vectorizer.io  ❞
- If it's generic icon ➜
    ❝  [Icon name] from Unicons / Feather / Lucide / Cryptocurrency Icons  ❞

❌ IT CANNOT BE JUST COPY-PASTE OF THE "URL of the site or app" PART. -->

**Background color info:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED, UNLESS it's generic icon.

Fill this part based of this information:
- Is the color taken somewhere from the logo?
   - If YES, then add & edit this text for eg ➜
      ❝  Background color is from the logo (`#add-hex-color-code-here`).  ❞
- Is color taken from the mentioned app / site? (And not from logo)
   - If YES, then do either/all of these things:
      - Upload screenshot of the area where you got the color AND give URL of the page (unless it's from app)
         - How to upload screenshot: https://is.gd/github_attach_files
      - Give the HTML element name (eg. #footer) AND also URL of the page.

After this line, you can now comment freely. Thank you for following the instructions. -->
