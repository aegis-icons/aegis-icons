<!--
🔔 When SUBMITTING ICON, please read this PR template CAREFULLY and follow the instructions!
     - But if the pull request DOESN'T relate to icon submissions, please ignore all of this (even the CONTRIBUTING check) and make PR from scratch.
       - For non icon related PRs, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO AT LEAST GLANCE THE CONTRIBUTING FILE for possible prohibited actions (eg. editing JSONs)

========== PULL REQUEST TITLE FORMAT ==========
Copy-paste one of these formats (the text inside of quotes)
to THE TOP TEXT FIELD and replace "icon_name_here" with
the name of the site / brand / company / app / generic symbol.

> If icon with logo ➜
   ❝  New icon: icon_name_here  ❞
> If icon update ➜
   ❝  Update icon: icon_name_here  ❞
> If generic icon ➜
   ❝  New icon: icon_name_here (generic)  ❞

Add either:

🔔 NOTE: Documentation link or screenshot should clearly mention that 2FA is (T)OTP / HOTP or any mobile 2FA app (eg. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, LastPass Authenticator etc.) or show section of the 2FA setup page with (censored) OTP 2FA QR code image. Otherwise, certainty cannot be established regarding 2FA compatibility for Aegis.
