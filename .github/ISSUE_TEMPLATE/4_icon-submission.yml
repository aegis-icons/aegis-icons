        ### :loudspeaker: Read and carefully follow our [CONTRIBUTING document](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
        :angry: **If you don't read & follow the CONTRIBUTING doc,** we might reject your icon submission(s) and, *in the worse case*, **get you banned.**
        
        *And do not send multiple icons in single issue, make multiple issues instead.*
        
        ### :triangular_flag_on_post: Issue title formatting *(top text field)*
        - Remember to add *name of the brand / site / app* at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
        - Please use proper capitalization / spelling for the name (check the capitalization / spelling from browser tab title or body text of their website, **not from the logo!**).
        - If it's icon update submission, add `(update)` at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
          - Eg. `Icon submission: Discord (update)`
        - If it's generic icon submission, add *short name for the icon* and `(generic)` at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
          - Eg. `Icon submission: Education (generic)`
        - **Do not change the formatting of the title!**
