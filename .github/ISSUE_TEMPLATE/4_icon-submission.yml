        ### :loudspeaker: Read and carefully follow our [CONTRIBUTING document](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
        :angry: **If you don't read & follow the CONTRIBUTING doc,** we might reject your icon submission(s) and, *in the worse case*, **get you banned.**.
        
        *And do not send multiple icons in single issue, make multiple issues instead.*
        
        ### :triangular_flag_on_post: Issue title formatting *(top text field)*
        - Remember to add *name of the brand / site / app* at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
        - Please use proper capitalization for the name (check the capitalization from their app / website).
        - Do not change the formatting of the title!
        - If it's icon update submission, add `(update)` at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
          - Eg. `Icon submission: Discord (update)`
        - If it's generic icon submission, add *short name for the icon* and `(generic)` at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
          - Eg. `Icon submission: Education (generic)`

        **For example:**
        
        - Direct URL of the press kit / branding page *(most prefered)*, logo vector file or [logo resource page](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#logos)
          - Examples:
            - `https://official-domain-of-the-app-or-site.com/press-kit-slash-branding-page`
            - `https://official-domain-of-the-app-or-site.com/logo.svg`
            - `https://unofficial-vector-logo-resource.com/exact-page-with-logo-resource`
        - Short info of how did you get the logo
          - For site embedded vectors, eg: `Extracted logo with SVG Gobbler from https://official-domain-of-the-app-or-site.com/exact-page`
          - For [image traced vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_tracing), eg: `Image traced of https://example.com/logo.jpg with Vectorizer.io`
        - *If it's generic icon:*
          - `[Icon name] from Unicons / Feather / Lucide / Cryptocurrency Icons`
        
        **It cannot be just duplication of** "URL of the site or app" **field text.**

        Fill this form based of this information:
        - *Is the color taken somewhere from the logo?*

        - *Is color taken from the mentioned app / site?* (And not from logo)
          - If **yes**, do either/all of these things:
            - [Upload](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) screenshot of the area where you got the color **and** give URL of the page
            - Give the HTML element name (eg. `#footer`) **and** URL of the page.
