        ### :loudspeaker: Read and carefully follow our [CONTRIBUTING document](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
        :angry: **If you don't read & follow the CONTRIBUTING doc,** we might reject your icon submission(s) and, *in the worse case*, **get you banned.**
        
        *And do not send multiple icons in single issue, make multiple issues instead.*
        
        ### :triangular_flag_on_post: Issue title formatting *(top text field)*
        - Remember to add *name of the brand / site / app* at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
        - Please use proper capitalization / spelling for the name (check the capitalization / spelling from browser tab title or body text of their website, **not from the logo!**).
        - If it's icon update submission, add `(update)` at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
          - Eg. `Icon submission: Discord (update)`
        - If it's generic icon submission, add *name of the icon* and `(generic)` at the end of *"Icon submission:"* text.
          - Eg. `Icon submission: Education (generic)`
        - **Do not change the formatting of the title!**

        *Add either:*
        - Link to documentation page / announcement post related to TOTP / Google Authenticator 2FA (**prefered option #1**)
        - Link to 2FA Directory's GitHub pull request page for the service ([search them here](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/pulls?q=is%3Apr), **prefered option #2**)
        - Screenshot proof of the TOTP / Google Authenticator 2FA settings page or login prompt **(if either prefered option wasn't available)**
          - :x: **NO screenshots from Aegis app, period!** Only from the service you have the account on.
          - *Censor sensitive info if needed (QR codes, 2FA seed codes, personal information etc.)*
          
        > **Note** – Documentation link or screenshot should clearly mention that 2FA is (T)OTP / HOTP or any mobile 2FA app (eg. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, LastPass Authenticator etc.) or show section of the 2FA setup page with *(censored)* OTP 2FA QR code image. **Otherwise we cannot be sure if 2FA actually is compatible for Aegis.**
        
        *This is optional, but **if we cannot find info about 2FA from the website, Google nor [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/int/)**, we have to ask you proof for it.*
