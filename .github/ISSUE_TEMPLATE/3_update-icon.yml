        ### :loudspeaker: [Read our issue guidelines first](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-guidelines) if you haven't already!
        :angry: **If you don't read / follow the issue guidelines**, your issue(s) might **get rejected** and, *in the worse case*, **get you banned.**
        *(Issue guidelines was last updated on: **2022-10-26**).*
        
        *And do not request multiple icons in single issue, make multiple issues instead.*
        
        ### :triangular_flag_on_post: Issue title formatting *(top text field)*
        - Remember to **add name of the brand / site / app** at the end of *"Update icon:"* text.
          - Eg. `Update icon: GitHub`
        - Please use proper capitalization / spelling for the name (check the capitalization / spelling from browser tab title or body text of their website, **not from the logo!**).
        - **Do not change the formatting of the title!**

        Remember to add *https://* (or *http://*) to start of the URL.
        Link should be the homepage of the site (not login page or any other miscellaneous page).
        
        - :globe_with_meridians: Please link to english version of the site, if site has that option!
        - :underage: If this entity is explicitly ["not safe for work"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work), please add ` (NSFW)` after the URL.
        - :warning: **Don't add Play Store link or other app store links**, unless requested entity doesn't have any other website.

        Optional option to add URL for *press kit* or *logo SVG / EPS / AI vector resource*, preferably from official source ([tips for finding these](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#finding-source-images)).
        
        - :x: **Unaccepted resources:** JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, ICO or [any other raster image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_format#Raster_formats_(2D)).
          - *[Why vector images instead of raster (a.k.a. bitmap) images](https://www.lifewire.com/vector-and-bitmap-images-1701238#toc-ease-of-use-vectors-are-more-robust)*.
        - :x: **NO [data URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme), SVG code** or anything **that's NOT web URL!** *(Forbidden because of long character lengths.)*
          - Data uri starts with: `data:image/` (and so on)
          - SVG code starts with: `<svg` (and so on)
        
        *Adding a optional resource doesn't guarantee that aegis-icons will use it for the icon.*
